This project is a scene of a simulated living room in the sky. There is a TV, shelf, paintings, couch, decorations, mirror, and the main chracter which is a robot. What inspired me in this scene is that I want to create a semi realistic scene while giving it a scifi feel. The main cahracter here is a robot which is basically a person living a normal human life.
